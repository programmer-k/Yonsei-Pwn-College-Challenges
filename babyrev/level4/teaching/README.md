The expected result is `63 66 6b 6e 72 73`, which is `cfknrs`.
Since the program will skip 4 bytes, add random 4 bytes before it.
For example, I used `aaaacfknrs`.
Write this value into the file named `vxhsq`.
The program will read the file not from the same directory with its location but the current working directory.
Thus, you can put the file in, for example, your home directory and run the program under it.
