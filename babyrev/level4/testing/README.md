You should first create a file named with `vffcn`.
Otherwise, the program halts.
Then, it skips 4 bytes.
After that, it reads 8 bytes.
Finally, it modifies the given data.
When you give `aaaahellojiu`, it is modified into `heluojil`.
Apart from first four bytes, the first three bytes `hel` remains the same.
`lojiu` becomes `uojil`, which means the first and the last character are swapped.

To produce `rpgpbizm`, you should swap the fourth and the last character, which becomes `rpgmbizp`.
Thus, the answer could be `aaaarpgmbizp`.


# Setting the same address between pwndbg and ghidra

The default option shows different address for the same instructions.
You can manually calculate the offset and add it, but it is quite tedious to do so.
`piebase` command from pwndbg gives base address.
When you enter the output value into ghidra `Window` `Memory Map` `Set Image Base`, the addresses become the same.
Now it becomes really easy to read code from ghidra and set a breakpoint in pwndbg when you want to run some parts.
