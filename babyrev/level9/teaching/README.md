This program reads the input from TCP socket.
Its socket will listen on the port `42334`.
Thus, we need to connect to this socket.

It skips 8 bytes and reads 10 bytes.
The expected result is `33 0d c4 0b 08 3d cc 13 3c 1e`, which is weird value in ASCII form.

The first mangler sorts the input in an ascending order.
The second mangler swaps between the third byte and the ninth byte.
The third mangler performs XOR operation with 0x5667bd60.
The fourth mangler swaps between the fifth byte and the sixth byte.

Reversing the third and fourth manglers, the expected result becomes `ejykkoqsjy`.
Thus, the answer should be `aaaabbbbejjkkoqsyy`.
