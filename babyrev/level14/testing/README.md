You cannot apply the previous interpreter since the instruction encoding has changed.

Similar to the teaching challenge, you first have to do basic analysis for examining encoding.

Please refer to `basic_analysis.txt` for this.

After that, you need to update `interpreter.py` for a new encoding scheme. Please note that the argument order for pushing and popping has changed.

Please refer to `interpreter.py` for updated interpreter and `interpreter_output.txt` for interpreter output.

The code looks similar but not exactly the same.

We can do the analysis again, but it would take a lot of time.

Thus, I just analyzed memory region so that I can find out correct key value stored in memory region.

Please refer to `memory_analysis.txt` for this.

There are suspicious 14 bytes from MEM[0x82] to MEM[0x8f].

I tried with this key but it did not work.

Then, I came up with omitting the first two bytes as in teaching challenge and it worked!

Use the following command to get the flag.
```
echo -e "\x4c\x86\xd2\xab\x34\x27\x97\x47\x57\xa8\xc2\x3b\x90\x2e" | /babyrev_level14_testing1
```
