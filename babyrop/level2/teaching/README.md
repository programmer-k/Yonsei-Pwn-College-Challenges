In this challenge, you now have to call two functions, which are `win_stage_1` and `win_stage_2`.

You can set the offset as `120` and give the address of each function in order.
The challenge will first return to `win_stage_1` and run it.
After that, the challenge will return to `win_stage_2` and run it.
Finally, you will get the flag.
