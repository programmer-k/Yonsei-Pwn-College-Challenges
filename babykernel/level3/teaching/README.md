In this challenge, you have to invoke the `win` function.

From the `device_ioctl` function, you can see the following code.
```
if (cmd == 1337) {
    __x86_indirect_thunk_rbx();
    lVar1 = 0;
}
```

I do not know exactly what `__x86_indirect_thunk_rbx` is, but it is obvious that we have to use 1337 for `cmd` and `RBX` register to call an arbitrary function.

I still do not know why it uses `RBX` function to call a function. Maybe calling convention inside the Linux kernel is different from syscall and user-level function call.

Anyway, the key point is that we can call an arbitrary function with the `RBX` register, more precisely, the third parameter `ulong arg` from the `device_ioctl` function.

Previously, we used the third parameter to pass the address of the buffer or string.

However, in this case, the parameter is not a pointer, instead it is `ulong` type.

Therefore, we should pass the argument with a value not a pointer.

Assuming that we can call an arbitrary function with the third parameter, we need to know the address of the `win` function.

This can be done with the following command.
```
cat /proc/kallsyms | grep "win"
```

`/proc/kallsyms` will print addresses for all symbols in Linux kernel and we can get the address of the `win` function with this functionality.

Here is what I got.
```
ffffffffc000020d t win  [challenge]
```

Finally, we can provide this information with the following code snippet.
```
unsigned long long data = 0xffffffffc000020dLL;
ioctl(fd, 1337, data);
```

We can get the flag with the following command.
```
gcc -static ioctl.c
./a.out
```
